* Update to work with 3.x kernels. While the differences between 2.6.32 (which
  this module was originally build for) and 3.2.0 (the kernel that shipped with
  Debian wheezy, and presumably subsequent kernels) aren't nearly as great as
  between 2.1.21 and 2.6.32, there are some differences that need to be dealt
  with before this will build against current Linux kernels.

* It is not certain that this will work with big endian architectures. It 
  probably should, for completeness, so that needs testing.

* Very large (for what xiafs considers very large) filesystems sometimes cause
  kernel panics when unmounting. This should be fixed, but doesn't seem to be
  a problem for smaller filesystems.

* Make installation process smoother.
